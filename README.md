# chatbot
voice chatbot

This project is a simple chatbot built with Node.js. It sets up a server using Express.js and allows real-time chatting through Socket.io. The chatbot listens to user messages, processes them, and replies instantly, just like a basic virtual assistant. It shows how we can combine backend logic with a web interface to create an interactive chat experience.

*SETUP*
step 1: Run npm install for installing dependency packages
step 2: To start the server, npm run dev (port 3000)
